#  AI Debate Simulator

A structured, multi-agent debate system powered by LangGraph and GroqCloud.  
Two AI agents engage in a round-based debate on a user-provided topic. After 8 turns (4 per agent), a judge node analyzes the discussion and declares a winner.

##  DAG: Debate Flow

```text
[UserInput]
     |
     v
  [AgentA]
     |
     v
  [Memory]
     |
     v
  [AgentB]
     |
     v
  [Memory]
     |
     .
     .
(repeats 4 total rounds)
     .
     .
     v
   [Judge]
     |
     v
    [END]
```

---

##  Logging

Each debate session is logged automatically. You’ll find a log file in the root directory, capturing:

* The topic
* All agent responses
* State transitions
* The final verdict
